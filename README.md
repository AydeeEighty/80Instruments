![Kaos](https://github.com/AydeeEighty/80Instruments/blob/master/images/kaos.png?raw=true)

Kaos - a random module that when triggered, outputs a random voltage based on switch. Outputs (0-1V, 0-5V, 0-10V).

AngryArp - a 16-step arpeggiator with -2 to +2 octave change.

![Sin](https://github.com/AydeeEighty/80Instruments/blob/master/images/sin.png?raw=true)

Sin - a basic sine oscillator.  It is a reskinned version of the test module from the [VCV Plugin Development](https://vcvrack.com/manual/PluginDevelopmentTutorial) tutorial.
